What is your name, major, and lab section?
  My name is Dean, my major is Computer Science, and my lab section is 1105
Do you have a partner for labs already?
  No, I don't have any partner yet
2a) If so, who?
  No one
If you don't have a partner and you'd like to choose (rather than being assigned), have you reached out using the class slack channel?
  Not yet, but I will definetely use it later or use another method of choosing the partner
Will you be using your personal computer for programming assignments and/or labs?
  Mostly I will use the lab computer, but in some cases I will use my own computer
4a) If so, do you already have a dev environment set up on your personal machine(remember, you'll need to install WSL if you're on a windows machine and add Visual Studio
Code)?
  Yes, I already have everything I need for working 
4ai) If you haven't set up an environment or you'd like to alter your previous environment, have you followed the instructions in the posted video to set one up on your 
local machine using VirtualBox (complete with git and your IDE)?
  I have everything setted up
